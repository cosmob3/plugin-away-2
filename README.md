### How did you install the library?
- As external code in a `<script>` element in the `<head>` element of the HTML file 
- I used a Content Delibery Network as it seems like the easier one to use.

## February 9, 2022
TODO: **Work on Plugin' Away - Achievement 1**
- Install a 3rd-party JS library
- Demo the library with a simple demo
- Distinguish between the various methods JS can be loaded into an HTML file
- Document this activity 

Was looking around for different libraries and I came across `three.js` and I love how it looks and what you can do with it.

Going to see if I'm successful in installing it!

Used Github to clone it down to my PC and I didn't realized it would take a bit to download.

So I don't really understand what is going on... maybe for a later time when I understand this better. 

Going to try `lodash`.

I tried it. Saw this video on youtube [What is Lodash and How it Works (for beginners)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyxliogSwrM&t=310s) By iEatWebsites that helped to understand some of the functions of lodash but I'm not sure how to demo it. Like I can see it in the `console` but I'm not sure what to add to the HTML to actually make the javascript useful.

I think I'll do the `reveal.js` for now and ask more about it tomorrow. I thought I was understanding this better but I'm still pretty lost...

Looks like we are making a slide show tonight!!!!

Made a random slide show but I'm pretty proud of it. I feel a little bit better about using `reaveal.js` in the future but would still like to learn how to do that with other libraries.
